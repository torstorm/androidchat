**Welcome to the AndroidChat project!**

AndroidChat is an open source IRC client built for Android phones. The application is still in the development stage but the code in the subversion trunk will build cleanly and run. Changes are committed to the subversion repository at least once a day. Active development is updated in our Git repository listed at the url below. Any questions feel free to ask at the Google Groups page linked on the right or you can check out our blog for updates on the status of the project also linked on the right.
